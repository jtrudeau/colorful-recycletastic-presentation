# RecyQuest: Speaker Notes for Presentation

## Slide 1: Title & Slogan
Welcome everyone! Today, we will present our innovative project, RecyQuest, a game designed to educate and encourage better recycling habits through interactive play.

## Slide 2: Team & Roles
We divided responsibilities based on our strengths to create this project together.

## Slide 3: Issue & Related Problem
Our project focuses on the issue of low participation in recycling and common mistakes in sorting recyclables. We identified that many students and community members face confusion or lack motivation.

## Slide 4: Possible Solutions & Team Focus
After brainstorming multiple approaches, we decided a game would be the most effective way to engage our peers in learning about recycling.

## Slide 5: Sustainable Development Goals
We align our project closely with SDGs 12 and 4, aiming to educate through gameplay while encouraging sustainable recycling practices.

## Slide 6: Background Research
Our background research showed that incorrect recycling stems from confusion, lack of motivation, and poor knowledge. For example, nearly 25% of recyclables end up contaminated due to incorrect sorting.

## Slide 7: Prototype of the Real-World Solution
RecyQuest is a Scratch-based game where players sort virtual items into the correct bins. Each correct sort earns points, and players advance through increasingly challenging levels.

## Slide 8: Demo
Let's see how the game works in action! [Demonstrate gameplay with a volunteer if possible]

## Slide 9: Testing & Feedback
We tested our prototype with classmates. Feedback included enthusiasm for competitive and collaborative gameplay, and useful suggestions that improved clarity and engagement.

## Slide 10: Next Steps
Looking ahead, we plan to refine our game further and potentially develop a mobile app. Integration into educational programs could amplify our impact.

## Slide 11: Q&A
Thank you for listening. We'd now love to answer any questions you might have.
